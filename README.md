I will share Korean diplomatic datasets and tools to analyze the data in `{kdiplo}` package. Currently, the only function here is `iso3c()` which allows you to convert Korean-language country names to ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes. I will add more functions and datasets in the future.

Let me know if there are additional Korean-language country names out there that are not included in the dataset. I will add them to the dataset.
