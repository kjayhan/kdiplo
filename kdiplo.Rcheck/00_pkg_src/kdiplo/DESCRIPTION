Description: Converts Korean country names into iso3c country codes. Korean governmental data often uses country names only in Korean, and without universal country codes. Sometimes, Korean-language country names are not consistent across different datasets. This function is designed to assign universal iso3c country codes to Korean-language country names that will make it easier to join different kinds of data.
